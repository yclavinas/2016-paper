Understanding the mechanisms and patterns of earthquake
  occurrence is of crucial importance for assessing and mitigating the
  seismic risk. In this work we analyze the viability of using
  Evolutionary Computation (EC) as a means of generating models for
  the occurrence of earthquakes. Our proposal is made in the context
  of the "Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability"
  (CSEP), an international effort to standardize the study and testing
  of earthquake forecasting models. We use a standard Genetic
  Algorithm (GA) with real valued genome, where each allele
  corresponds to a bin in the forecast model. The design of an
  appropriate fitness function is the main challenge for this task,
  and we describe two different proposals based on the log-likelihood
  of the candidate model against the training data set. The resulting
  forecasts are compared with the Relative Intensity algorithm, which
  is traditionally employed by the CSEP community as a benchmark,
  using data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) earthquake
  catalog. The forecasts generated by the GA were competitive with the
  benchmarks, specially in scenarios with a large amount of inland
  seismic activity.
